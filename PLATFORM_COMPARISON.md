## ⚠️ Free Tier Consideration

**Render free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity**

**What this means:**
- First request after sleep: 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Subsequent requests: Fast (normal speed)
- WebSocket connections may disconnect during sleep

**Solutions:**

1. **Upgrade to paid ($7/month)** - Best solution, always-on
2. **Use uptime monitor** - Ping service every 10 min (keeps it awake)
3. **Accept the limitation** - Fine for demo/personal projects
